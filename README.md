Right now, only these commands are implemented:

1. Option 0 - Return current coordinates
2. Option 1 - Motion alert
3. Option 4 - Send interval
4. Option 6 - EEPROM configuration

I am not associated with the maker of Geogram ONE in any way.  I bought a Geogram ONE and wrote this app for my own use.
